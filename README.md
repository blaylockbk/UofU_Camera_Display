# UofU_Camera_Display
A web interface for viewing weather cameras deployed by the MesoWest group at 
the University of Utah.


Basically, you can view the cameras in real time. If you click the image you
are directed to a new webpage where you can view time lapse videos.

This project needs some love. Code could be simplified and cleaned up, made
easier to add new cameras when necessary.
